# The Leek group guide to career planning

This guide is a slightly modified version of the [Langmead Lab career planning guide](https://github.com/BenLangmead/langmead-lab/blob/master/postdoc_questionnaire.md) that is awesome and was created by [Ben Langmead](http://www.langmead-lab.org/). 


## Why plan your career?

I know that you want to be a scientist because you love science. That is why we all want to be scientists. But if you want to be a professional scientist and get paid money to do it, you will also need a plan for professional development. Having a career in science can be incredibly rewarding - teaching students, doing research you consider important, and communicating those ideas to a big audience are all great. There are also some things about it that are hard. One thing that I think is unnecessarily hard is career planning. If you use this guide it can help you make sense of the opportunities and challenges that come with a data science career starting as a grad student or postdoc in my group.  

## Why this guide?

One major purpose of graduate school or a postdoc is to prepare you for your dream job. Grad school/a postdoc is extremely valuable time.  Making yourself an attractive job candidate is a full time job.  This document is one way that I will encourage you to do something you must do, no matter how painful it is.  __You must make a plan__.  This is not just a matter of listing your research goals, though thatâ€™s part of it.


## Industry versus academia

I think some students are under the impression that faculty really want them to get academic jobs after graduating and would be disappointed if they don't get one. I don't know if that is true for other people but it definitely isn't true for me. My only goal when you graduate and go get a job is that you get a job you like that makes you happy. So this guide will be agnostic to industry/academia. 

## Figuring out what you want to do

One of the hardest parts of planning as a graduate student or postdoc is figuring out what you want to do next. If you have questions about this you should come ask [your advisor](http://jtleek.com/). But here are some relatively rough guidelines of the types of jobs that you could go after (this list is non-exhaustive and if you want to do something else, that is great, but we might need to adapt the plan). These are by necessity very brief. Rafa's post on [hard/soft money jobs](http://simplystatistics.org/2011/12/19/on-hard-and-soft-money/) and my adendum on [liberal arts colleges](http://simplystatistics.org/2011/09/15/another-academic-job-market-option-liberal-arts/) as well as this excellent post on [academia versus industry for a junior person](http://www.pgbovine.net/academia-industry-junior-employee.htm) are great places to start reading more. 

* __Tenure track faculty/principal investigator__: You will primarily be writing lots of papers and to a greater or lesser extent (a) teaching, (b) writing grants, and (c) advising students. This job has some pressure associated with it because you are usually expected to get grants/write methods papers where you are in charge, but in some ways has the most freedom if you are successful.
* __Research track faculty__: This job varies a ton by institution. It can be anything from a heavy teaching load to pure research and everything in between. Some places, like Hopkins, tend to treat these faculty really well. But that isn't universally true. These jobs tend to require you to get fewer individual grants/write fewer methods papers but that isn't a rule either.
